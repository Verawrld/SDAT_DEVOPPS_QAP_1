    1. Clean code examples in my code are as follows
        - Example 1: Meaningful Variable Names
           in the `GameStoreTest.java` file, meaningful variable names are used to improve 
           readability and maintainability. For instance, the variable `store` clearly indicates 
           that it represents an instance of the `GameStore` class.
           

        -Example 2: Single Responsiblity Principle
            Each method has a single responsiblity For example the AddGameToCart method 
            in resposible for only adding a game to the cart

        -Example 3: Descriptive Test Methods
            Test methods in the code are named more Descriptively to indicate what they are testing, 
            to make it easier to understand the purpose on first glance

    2. Project overview 
        The GameStoreSystem is a project of a basic game store application that allows to do 3 functions,
         add games to cart, calculate the total price, and checkout. The project includes unit test to ensure 
         the functionality works as expected. 
            
            How it works:
                Adding games to cart: Users can add games to thier cart by calling the addGameToCart method
                calculating Total: The total price of the games in the cart is calculated using the calculateTotal method
                Checkout: The checkout method clears the cart after the transation

            Test cases:
                TestAddGameToCart: Verifies that a game is added to the cart 
                TestCartTotalCalculation: Ensures the total price calculation is right
                TestCheckoutClearsCart: Confirms that the cart is emplty after checkout
